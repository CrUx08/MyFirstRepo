Hi, my name is Prince Imbabazi, a passionate software engineer and tech enthusiast based in Rwanda. I have a strong foundation in backend development, working mainly with Django, SQL, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code and I'm currently focused on building impactful digital solutions through my startup, Crux — a platform that empowers remote work with a developer-first mindset.

Beyond code, I'm also committed to personal growth and community building. I’ve led peace initiatives during my school days and worked on various collaborative coding projects like shop management systems and web apps. I'm currently learning through programs like ALX and CS50, and I'm always eager to learn, share, and build meaningful tech.
